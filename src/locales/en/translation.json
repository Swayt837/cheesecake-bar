    "title": "Our Story",
    "story_1": "Cheesecake Bar is a simple story: Sara and Florian, two passions, and a shared desire… to create desserts that make people feel good.",
    "story_2": "Sara spent 10 years in cooking and pastry. She has an eye that never lets anything slide: the texture must be perfect, the balance just right, and every detail must have a reason to be there. I'm Florian, I come from the world of bar and luxury events. I've learned that what you remember from a moment isn't just the taste… it's the emotion, the atmosphere, and that little touch that makes the moment unique.",
    "story_3": "We created Cheesecake Bar to offer that every day: a premium dessert, elegant, but above all comforting. Cheesecake cups crafted with precision, generous without being heavy, indulgent without being \"too much\". Recipes that make you want to close your eyes for a second, just to savor.",
    "story_4": "Behind every cup, there's time, trials, adjustments, sometimes nights spent starting over to get it \"just the way we want it\". Because we don't want to make \"just another dessert\". We want to make your favorite dessert. The one you have \"just once\"… then a second time.",
    "story_5": "Cheesecake Bar is for everyone: to treat yourself, to share, to mark a moment, even a simple one. And sometimes, when the occasion calls for it, we take our world further with an event version, more staged, more spectacular — but always true to our signature: taste, elegance, and emotion.",
    "story_mission": "At the end of the day, our mission has been the same from the start: to create a dessert that doesn't just taste good… but leaves something behind.",
